# MagLev Fan
## A FAN OF DREAMS

The aim of the project is to manufacture a simple, efficient and cost effective fan which overcomes most of the drawbacks of the conventional fans available in the market. The system of MagLev fan works on the principle of magnetic levitation, which suspends the rotor of the fan in a cushion of air, such that the rotor is completely independent of the stationary parts of the fan, thus providing less chance for friction. The considerable reduction in the friction also helps to reduce other loss factors such as noise, heat etc. The independent motion of the rotor also helps to attain greater speeds under less power, reducing power consumption. The other advantages of the fan includes high temperature endurance, longer life, prevention of dust penetration, multiple orientation with no noise occurred, lower power consumption, cost effectiveness and less maintenance.
